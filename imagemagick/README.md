These scripts create thumbnail derivatives of digital objects for use on DIMES, plus additional actions.

##makeThumb.sh
Creates several different derivative thumbnails of digital objects and then moves files from a temporary directory to a web accessible directory.

##makeThumbRepair.sh
Does the same thing as makeThumbs.sh, but is intended to be run once objects have already been moved to web accessible directory.
