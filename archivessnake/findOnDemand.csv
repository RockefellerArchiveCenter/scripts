There is minimal documentation for his tenure at Pomona College, the Office of Strategic Services and later Department of State, Muhlenberg College, and Grolier, Inc.  More detailed information exists for his five years at Miami University, and extensive documentation is included for his career at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan.    The Rockefeller Foundation diaries are an incomplete set and are draft versions of the final diaries filed with the Rockefeller Foundation and found in their archives.  The drafts do not appear to differ significantly from the final versions.  Of interest in this series is Fahs’s report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.  Researchers interested in the early career of Charles Burton Fahs should also explore the correspondence files in Series 1 dated from this period; during his early career, there was an overlap between Fahs’s personal and professional life.  Series 4, Manuscripts, Publications, and Speeches contains the many articles and book reviews written by Fahs during his time at Pomona College, as well as other articles and speeches made throughout his career.

In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council.

f7640f00641b4c97878817850216f640,Society for a More Beautiful National Capital,1968,,,Grants (series),,"The Grants series documents the Taconic Foundation's grantmaking from its inception in the late 1950s and early 1960s up to, but generally not including, its final grant cycles and spend-down in 2008-2012. Records concerning these latter grants are found, for the most part, not in the Grants series, but in the Organization Records series, under ""Grantmaking and Foundation History"" or under ""Spend-Down Process."" These late grants are grouped collectively rather than by individual grantee.  Grant files contain proposals, correspondence, and reports, and sometimes publications or literature relating to the institution or the particular grant. Most grant files also include one or more grant memos, which Taconic Foundation officers wrote for each new grant or renewal, setting forth for the board the terms of the request, the nature of the organization and its history with Taconic, previous funding, the pros and cons of the proposed grant, its fit with the Taconic program, and the recommended action.  The Taconic Foundation also funded a number of ""Projects"" that produced research and reports on issues of concern to the foundation or that resulted in the creation of new organizations that then benefited from Taconic grant support. Projects included, for example, the Assessment Project on Negro Needs, Davidoff's and Gold's proposals for low-income housing in lower Manhattan, the Voter Education Project, the Smokey House Project, and the Cooperative Assistance Fund.   A number of simple correspondence files are interspersed in this grants series. Each of these files generally contains just a few pieces of correspondence. While some correspondents have connections to Taconic projects, for the most part the correspondence files seem to be remnants of either a finite correspondence or a larger series. There is no general correspondence series in the Taconic records, and the Grants series constitutes the main series of files.  The Grants series is fairly comprehensive, but it is not a complete set of grant files. Some significant reports, such as Mary Conway Kohler's study of Youth and Work in New York, are not found in the files. Records are sparse or sometimes lacking for some of the Taconic Foundation's early grants. Many of the early programs were first launched with personal grants from the Curriers before the Taconic Foundation assumed their funding, and these hybrid origins may, perhaps, account for some of the gaps.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council.

There is minimal documentation for his tenure at Pomona College, the Office of Strategic Services and later Department of State, Muhlenberg College, and Grolier, Inc.  More detailed information exists for his five years at Miami University, and extensive documentation is included for his career at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan.    The Rockefeller Foundation diaries are an incomplete set and are draft versions of the final diaries filed with the Rockefeller Foundation and found in their archives.  The drafts do not appear to differ significantly from the final versions.  Of interest in this series is Fahs’s report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.

Reports,1955,,,Asian Interests (subseries),,"Through correspondence, reports, and memoranda, this subseries documents Rockefeller's interest in and commitment to Asia. Rockefeller was deeply concerned about the need for increasing America's understanding and appreciation of the peoples of Asia. To that end, he was involved in the support of cultural exchange programs; the revival of the Japan Society; the formation of the Asia Society; the construction of Asia House, the Asia Society's New York City headquarters; and the construction of the International House of Japan in Tokyo. The files documenting the teaching of the English language in Japan (folders 452-455) reflect Rockefeller's belief in the importance of English to Japan's growth in the international community. Also included here are files relating to the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. (CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478). Also represented here are two commercial ventures developed by Rockefeller to sell in the United States quality merchandise manufactured in Asia, namely, Products of Asia, Inc. and Products of India, Inc.

e50d761e6db844fd84c9c67918e1d84c,"Biography - ""A Conversation with Charles Burton Fahs"" and Chronology",1984,,,Personal papers (series),,"This series consists of family materials and correspondence, as well as several versions of a biography of Charles Burton Fahs compiled and written by Jamie Ross Fahs.  This series also contains information on Burton’s education, and his illness and death.  There are files of correspondence and clippings which post-date Burton’s death; these materials were received and collected by Jamie Ross Fahs and were included in the collection because of their connection to Burton’s life and career.  The correspondence folders are extremely rich and detailed and provide a window into the lives and activities of Burton and Jamie throughout their lives.  Folders which begin with the word Correspondence indicate that the letters in the file are written by Burton.  Incoming correspondence is rare, and there are no letters between the spouses.    Correspondence from Burton’s childhood includes letters written or received by his parents, as well as maternal aunt Abbie Lyon Sharman, her husband Harry Sharman, and maternal uncle D. Willard Lyon and his wife Grace.  Burton was a regular correspondent with his family during his college and graduate school years.  After they were married, Burton and Jamie took turns writing to his family.  There are also a few letters to Jamie’s mother.  Both Burton and Jamie were faithful correspondents, writing every one to two weeks.  The letters dating from 1933-1936, when they lived abroad, are particularly fascinating for the details they offer of living conditions and adjustments to cultural differences.  During Burton’s career at the Embassy, Jamie served as the family’s main correspondent and wrote lengthy letters about both of their activities and travels in Asia.  Annual Christmas letters for the years 1951 through 1980 detail the family life of the Fahses and is the primary source of information about their lives during the period 1951-1961.    The files relating to the biography (or biographies) of Charles Burton Fahs all draw from the same material and build upon each other.  Jamie’s first biography was based on the oral history interview of Burton conducted by Caroline Bailey at the time of the donation of Burton’s library to Earlham College.  To this she added an extensive chronology of his life and selected correspondence and writings.  Finally Jamie and her daughter Barbara attempted a full biography, a draft of which is included.  Jamie also corresponded with Burton’s colleagues and their friends for comments on the biography draft and for additional information to enhance the story.  Burton’s later years are chronicled in Jamie’s journal, found in Box 4, Folder 56. The four folders of condolences and the programs and readings from the memorial services (Box 3, Folders 35-40) offer a perspective on Burton’s interactions and relationships with many colleagues and friends, as well as his impact on Japanese studies, American-Japanese cultural relationships, and international relations.   A scrapbook (Box 5, Folder 63) about Burton’s childhood, created by his mother Sophie, contains his parents’ letters and notes about Burton’s infancy and childhood, letters from Harvey to his children during his travels, and childhood and teenage letters to Harvey from Burton.

e3f89637a82c40a487f95c4602398793,Johns Hopkins University - Atlantic Studies,1977,,,American Cultural Heritage (series),,"In late 1970 the officers of the Rockefeller Foundation allocated $300,000 to launch a program of grants to individuals engaged in the study of America's ""cultural heritage."" The following year, they appropriated an additional $500,000 to support similar initiatives on an institutional level.  Taking shape in a time of political, social, and cultural ferment, the American Cultural Heritage Program broadly aspired to ""provide an alternative"" to the ""cynicism"" and ""self-doubt"" that seemed to characterize Americans' understanding of their nation and their past. The alternative the officers envisioned was no simple-minded recitation of American myths, but rather a careful and creative reexamination of America's heritage ""in the light of present problems."" Greater self-understanding would lead to greater ""awareness among Americans of their historical and cultural interdependence,"" a necessary first step to surmounting the problems that divided them. Such a critical reappraisal would also be a worthy contribution to the approaching national bicentennial commemoration.  The Cultural Heritage Program sought out promising younger scholars in the humanities and social sciences and particularly valued creative and interdisciplinary approaches. ""Intellectual excellence, broad social commitment, and an imaginative approach"" were the criteria that would guide institutional grants. With both the individual and institutional grants, the Foundation's goal was to ""make an important contribution to the self-understanding of America's populace,"" and then to help shape the future by disseminating these new views of the past through formal and informal educational programs.  The projects funded vary widely but are notable for the impetus they display to seek out new questions and new ways of answering them. The question of ""identities"" and the contributions of minorities to the American nation were primary areas of study. Grantees studied transitions in Alaskan Eskimo life, Emancipation Day celebrations, Chinese workers in Oregon, recent immigrant communities, the role of black religion, and the works of black and women writers. The grants favored projects that sought to apply new disciplines and new techniques to the consideration of American culture. Through oral histories and field research, historians and others used the tools of anthropology to understand their own society. Oral history projects documented labor unrest in the Midwest, southern politicians, and American music, among other topics. On an institutional level, American Cultural Heritage grants launched major centers for the study of Atlantic, Southern, and Appalachian history.  Film, television production, and photographic studies make up another segment of these grants. Projects funded include photographic studies of the American farm, of four Texas counties, of grassroots Christianity, and of blacks in America. Films on folk traditions and television productions on the history of a New England mill town and on the social history of technology in America also received support. The University of Iowa received funding for a program to integrate the study of film and American civilization.  While some projects, like the Atlantic Studies Center at Johns Hopkins University, received major funding and some grants went to well-established scholars and institutions, the foundation's concern to cast its grants widely is striking. In assessing a grant to collect a history of the Gros Ventre tribe, for example, the foundation officer noted that while they could look for someone with ""fancier credentials,"" they might also give ""direct and substantial encouragement"" to this ""diligent amateur."" The foundation also was concerned, in redressing the historical record, that the story be told by those who had lived it. The focus on oral history reflects this interest, but the concern was really a broader one to empower minorities to interpret their own heritage. Officers carefully considered a scholar's rapport with the community under study and gave extra weight to a shared regional or ethnic background. They favored one proposal, for example, because it presented the ""possibility of furthering Southern Studies by people from this region, in this region."" Some grants trained individuals in techniques that could then be brought back to the community.  The smallest grant - for $615 - allowed a scholar to complete a study of the black poet and novelist Jean Toomer. As the final grant report noted, people were impressed that ""of all the RF's worldwide activities, . . . we could still take time to make such a small grant for such an obscure project.""  While the American Cultural Heritage Program was a limited initiative, it is interesting to see the ways it intersected with and helped shape new initiatives in historical study. It encouraged interdisciplinary and particularly anthropological approaches to historical questions, supported the study of folklore, family history, religion, labor history, women's studies, community and regional studies, and embraced the application of new media to the presentation of traditional subjects. That these approaches are commonplace in textbooks today attests in some measure to the program's success. Researchers may also find in these files reflections of present-day concerns with cultural identity, heritage, and meaning.

Roosevelt that expressed concern over Nazi influence in that region and recommended a program of U.S. cooperation and assistance to raise the standard of living in Latin America and to improve relations between the nations of the western hemisphere. President Roosevelt responded by appointing Rockefeller to head a new program that became the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.

In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council.

(CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478). Also represented here are two commercial ventures developed by Rockefeller to sell in the United States quality merchandise manufactured in Asia, namely, Products of Asia, Inc. and Products of India, Inc. These companies, which were meant to increase trade and encourage cultural contact, were sold in 1965. | For additional Matsumoto family correspondence see series 3, subseries 2, folder 147.",John D.

The Taconic Foundation also funded a number of ""Projects"" that produced research and reports on issues of concern to the foundation or that resulted in the creation of new organizations that then benefited from Taconic grant support. Projects included, for example, the Assessment Project on Negro Needs, Davidoff's and Gold's proposals for low-income housing in lower Manhattan, the Voter Education Project, the Smokey House Project, and the Cooperative Assistance Fund.   A number of simple correspondence files are interspersed in this grants series. Each of these files generally contains just a few pieces of correspondence. While some correspondents have connections to Taconic projects, for the most part the correspondence files seem to be remnants of either a finite correspondence or a larger series. There is no general correspondence series in the Taconic records, and the Grants series constitutes the main series of files.  The Grants series is fairly comprehensive, but it is not a complete set of grant files. Some significant reports, such as Mary Conway Kohler's study of Youth and Work in New York, are not found in the files. Records are sparse or sometimes lacking for some of the Taconic Foundation's early grants. Many of the early programs were first launched with personal grants from the Curriers before the Taconic Foundation assumed their funding, and these hybrid origins may, perhaps, account for some of the gaps.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council. Most of the files in this section are from the 30's and 40's.   Directors of the social science program were Edmund E. Day (1929-1937), Sydnor H. Walker, Acting (1937-1938), and Joseph H.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council.

He received his B.S. degree from Taylor University in Upland in 1921. From the University of Michigan he received the following degrees: in 1921, an A.B.; in 1929, an M.D.; and in 1931, an M.S. From 1919-1920, Dr. Bugher served as Instructor in Mathematics and Physics at Taylor University; from March 1926-1928, he was Director of Public Health at South Haven, Michigan; and from 1922 until 1937 he was on the faculty of the University of Michigan, first as Assistant in Bacteriology from 1922-1926, then as Senior Instructor in Pathology from 1929-1932, and finally as Assistant Professor of Pathology from 1933 to 1937, when he resigned to join the Rockefeller Foundation.  His first two months with the Foundation, from October to December 1937, Dr. Bugher spent in the Foundation's Yellow Fever Laboratories in New York City, becoming familiar with current yellow fever research and techniques prior to an assignment to Colombia, South America. At the end of December he left for Colombia to participate in the laboratory and field investigations in yellow fever being carried on there. During his last three years in Columbia (1940-1943), he served as Director of the Seccion de Estudios Especiales. From October 1943 until October 1948, Dr. Bugher's headquarters were in Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa, where he established the Yellow Fever Institute and served as its Director. Here research in yellow fever, including jungle yellow fever, was carried on, involving not only laboratory studies, but field operations in the forest and other areas of that part of Africa. Upon Dr. Bugher's return to the United States, he was again assigned to the Foundation's laboratories, where his particular responsibilities were the biophysical studies of viruses from January 1949 until March 1951.  He was then granted a leave of absence by the Foundation to become Deputy Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission from 1951-1952, and then Director from 1952 until 1955. In April 1955, Dr. Bugher returned to active duty with the Rockefeller Foundation and was Director for Medical Education and Public Health from then until April 1959, when he was appointed Consultant on Nuclear Energy Affairs. From April to the end of September 1955, the effective date of Dr. Bugher's resignation from the Atomic Energy Commission, he carried dual Foundation and AEC responsibilities.  While with the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Bugher participated in the testing of various fission and thermonuclear devices, leading to improved weapons; and was in close touch with research activities in the biological sciences and closely associated with and responsible for many of the developments connected with the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the medical field. In the summer of 1955, Dr. Bugher went to Geneva, Switzerland, as an official adviser to the United States Delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He also attended the Second International Conference in Geneva, in September 1958.  Dr. Bugher was a member of various committees in the field of atomic energy, including the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee for Biology and Medicine, of which he was appointed Vice Chairman in January 1959 and Chairman in June 1960; the Committee on Atomic Bomb Casualties and the Committee on Pathological Effects of Atomic Radiation of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council; the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements; the By-Laws and Rules Committee and the Nominating Committee of American Nuclear Society, of which he was also a member of the Board of Directors; the American Public Health Association Program Area Committee on Radiological Health; Brookhaven National Laboratory (Associated Universities, Inc.) Medical Department Visiting Committee - elected Chairman in May,1960; Committee on New Frontiers of Technology of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Health Physics Advisory Board; Mayor's (New York City) Technical Advisory Committee on Radiation, of which he was Chairman; New York State's General Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy; University of Michigan Law School Atomic Energy Advisory Committee; the World Health Organization Panel on Radiation, and the Puerto Rico Nuclear Center Medical Advisory Committee.  Dr. Bugher was also a member of the National Institute for Disaster Mobilization, Inc., and the New York City Health Research Advisory Council.  His membership in scientific societies included the Academy of Political Science; Federation of American Societies for Experimental Pathology and Experimental Biology; American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists; the Michigan Pathological Society; the American Cancer Society; the American Association of Cancer Research; the American Medical Association; the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine; the Royal Geographical Society; the American Public Health Association; the Health Physics Society; the American Nuclear Society; the Radiation Research Society; the New York Academy of Sciences, the honorary societies of Alpha Omega Alpha and Sigma Xi. At the University of Michigan, he was a member of the Gamma Alpha Sigma and Phi Rho Sigma fraternities.  During Dr. Bugher's services with the Foundation and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, he received various honors, including the award from the President of Colombia in 1943 of the Cruz de Boyaca, and life and honorary membership in the Academy of Medicine of Bogota, Colombia; the bestowal on him in 1948 of the Commander of the Order of the British Empire; the honorary degree of Sc.D. from Taylor University in 1953; the presentation on September 20, 1955, by Chairman Lewis Strauss of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Distinguished Service Award and Superior Accomplishment Award; the receipt on May 9, 1956, of the Howard Taylor Ricketts' Award at the University of Chicago, and the Alumnus of the Y ear Award for 1956, from Taylor University on June 1, 1956. In December 1958, Dr. Bugher was made an Honorary Member of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile in Santiago.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

Of interest in this series is Fahs’s report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.

Acme Oil Company; relations between executive and manufacturing committees; production; quality of oil; production of competitors.",Business (subseries),,"The business correspondence contains an avalanche of information about the far-flung activities of the Rockefeller empire. From all over the country and from around the world there flowed data, information, and rumor. Reports to the Executive Committee of Standard Oil showed how the firm dealt with the first really effective challenges to its international hegemony in the 1880s, the result of the discovery and exploitation of vast fields in Russia, developed by the Nobel interests. The task of keeping order in the industry was never-ending, as can be seen, for example, in the files from Standard executive John Archbold. The company's hold on the domestic transport of oil was threatened by a succession of competitors and opponents from time to time. For example, Archbold wrote to Rockefeller in 1886: ""We learn today to our great surprise and disgust that Penna. RR is furnishing Tank cars to the Holdship pipe Line for shipment of crude oil East. Have telegraphed protest strongly.""* Similarly, the international struggle required constant vigilance: ""We are considering the question of sending somebody to the Far East . . . the Russians are making very aggressive efforts in these mkts.""** By contrast, at moments when all was well within Standard's empire, Archbold could report what Rockefeller longed to hear: ""pressing sales of refined in all directions as vigorously as possible. Everything moving along quietly and well.""***   Equally important were the continuous summaries of quantitative data, the informational lifeblood of a modern business enterprise. Reports on stocks of crude oil, kerosene, and lubricants came constantly from New Jersey, from Marseilles, from the Far East, and from all over the world. Data on productivity and profitability were especially prevalent, such as reports on the monthly yields of various products per hundred gallons of crude in Standard's different refineries around the country, including conclusions about the total value of the product, the cost of refining, and the net value of goods produced at each site. No detail seemed to be too small to require at least a summary for the firm's head, including data on the monthly amounts paid to Western Union in Cleveland for telegrams. Information on insurance, news of competitors' new or rumored refineries or transportation facilities, measures of performance by individual managers or refineries, real estate deals, and political and legal intelligence were generated in staggering volume. Important moments in history are here, such as the telegram from Standard's lawyer and lobbyist in Washington that brought John D. Rockefeller word of Senate passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. ""Senate has just passed the Judiciary Committee trust bill all amendments being voted down,"" J. H. Flagg wired Rockefeller at his residence at 4 W. 54th Street in Manhattan in April of 1890. ""There was but little debate and only one Senator Blodgett of New Jersey voted against the bill.""**** A little more than twenty years later, that act would be used to break up Standard Oil in the landmark Supreme Court case of 1911.   In these voluminous business files we see also the communications to their leader from many of the able lieutenants and associates in Standard, such as John Archbold, Henry Flagler, and Henry Folger. Here, in short, we can see the details of how the great Standard Oil Trust did its work.

There is minimal documentation for his tenure at Pomona College, the Office of Strategic Services and later Department of State, Muhlenberg College, and Grolier, Inc.  More detailed information exists for his five years at Miami University, and extensive documentation is included for his career at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan.    The Rockefeller Foundation diaries are an incomplete set and are draft versions of the final diaries filed with the Rockefeller Foundation and found in their archives.  The drafts do not appear to differ significantly from the final versions.  Of interest in this series is Fahs’s report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.  Researchers interested in the early career of Charles Burton Fahs should also explore the correspondence files in Series 1 dated from this period; during his early career, there was an overlap between Fahs’s personal and professional life.  Series 4, Manuscripts, Publications, and Speeches contains the many articles and book reviews written by Fahs during his time at Pomona College, as well as other articles and speeches made throughout his career.

944b8f1ca4734a6bbb9eba21a7e7a2c1,United Nations International School,1972,,,Subject Files (series),,"The Subject Files series contains the topical subject files, documenting some of the issues and activities with which the Foundation was involved during the 1970s. The lesser documented topics include the Foundation’s involvement with a few grantees, such as the New York Public Library, the Travel Program for Foreign Diplomats, and the United Nations International School. The series is dominated, however, by the topics of affirmative action and retrenchment of the Foundation's expenses. This is a reflection of the importance that Ivy's supervisor, Arthur Trottenberg, attached to these two issues.    Affirmative action became a significant social movement in the 1970s. To keep with the times, the Foundation fully embraced the new movement in a number of ways. For example, the Foundation restructured its staff in order to move women and minorities from ""support"" positions into ""professional"" positions. Ford also sought to hire women and minorities from outside the Foundation, to serve as both Foundation employees and contracted consultants. In addition to exercising affirmative action internally, the Foundation began an external affirmative action program, placing a high priority on selecting grantees whose projects emphasized the realization of equal opportunity for women and minorities. The affirmative action folders in the Subject Files series document the Foundation's creation of, and adherence to, affirmative action policies. For more information on the Foundation's affirmative action programs, researchers can refer to the Trottenberg collection.  Another significant issue for the Foundation during this period in Ivy’s tenure was the retrenchment of the Foundation’s expenses. Trottenberg was involved extensively with the Foundation's retrenchment program, so it is not surprising that this issue comprises the majority of Ivy's Subject Files series. The latter half of the 1970s was marked by a period of severe reduction of the Foundation's general management costs and program budgets. Originally, the Foundation initiated financial reductions to promote longevity of the Foundation's assets, but the bad economies of 1973 and 1974 compounded the need for retrenchment. Severe budget cuts were required to maintain the Foundation’s stability. Thus, Ford launched a Foundation-wide retrenchment program, which affected all areas of spending – from reducing the size and number of grants awarded to terminating the employment of a number of staff members. The retrenchment folders in the Subject Files series document the Foundation's plans and projections associated with this retrenchment of expenses. For more information on the Foundation's period of retrenchment, researchers can refer to the Trottenberg collection.",Ford Foundation records,"Office of the Vice President, Logistical Services, Office Files of James T.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

Rockefeller (OMR). The office was located in Rockefeller Center on the 56th floor of the main building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, contemporaneously referred to as the RCA Building.   Mr. Rockefeller’s personal files begin with his formative years and education, documenting his early interest in science and his family’s extensive travels. But the focus of this record group is the 15 years following his service during World War II in the U.S. Army, when David Rockefeller was establishing himself in the arenas of banking, international business, and philanthropy. While his personal and philanthropic activities are well represented in the files, the business records of his 35-year career with Chase Bank are not part of this collection.  The largest portion of this record group comprises 21 boxes of personal correspondence that date from the immediate post-war period until 1961. Mostly unsolicited, these letters come from friends and acquaintances from across the globe and amply illustrate the vast range of relationships he cultivated through the years. Mr. Rockefeller often heard from individuals he met during his wartime service in France and Algiers—which was, in his own words, “the beginning of a networking process that I would follow throughout my life.”* Correspondents of note include Alfred Barr, Jr., Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Allen and John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dag Hammarskjold, General George C. Marshall, Robert Moses, Arthur Sulzberger, and William Zorach.  Personal correspondence with his parents, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, dates from 1925 until his graduation from Harvard University in 1936, and later with solely his father following Abby’s death in 1948. While there are a handful of files related to David Rockefeller’s wedding to Margaret McGrath and their honeymoon in Wyoming, there is no correspondence between the two prior to their marriage in 1940. Likewise, there is little to no correspondence with his sister and four brothers. Correspondence regarding his children remains closed to research during their respective lifetimes.  Among topics of note in this record group is David Rockefeller’s close association with Harvard University that spans several decades. This includes folders on his financial support of the institution, as well as his lengthy service on its Board of Overseers. Additionally, folders on his 25th class reunion in 1961—for which he was elected Chief Marshall of the event—are complemented by details of his efforts to mount a special art exhibition for the occasion. Other aspects of his lifelong love of art are evident in the folders on the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother co-founded and on whose board Mr. Rockefeller served starting in 1948. Furthermore, information on the origins of his own art collecting is found in Folders 210-217.  From a young age, David Rockefeller fully embraced his family’s tradition of extensive travel. His 1932 handwritten accounts of a biking trip in England before starting college detailed the summer adventure in letters home to his parents (Folder 437). In 1935, he toured dozens of European art museums with close friend Richard Gilder, his Harvard roommate who later died while serving as a combat pilot in World War II. During that trip, Richard wrote a particularly poignant letter to Abby Rockefeller that describes their summer travels through Europe and focuses on the ominous developments in Germany as the continent headed toward war (Folder 441).  Lastly, this record group includes personal and quasi-professional files from 1959 to 1981 that the Chase Manhattan Bank transferred to the family office following David Rockefeller’s retirement in 1981. These are mostly chronological, event-specific folders.  * Rockefeller, David, Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002, page 122.",David Rockefeller papers,,FA436,1985,"Open for research with select materials restricted as noted.

Strong's correspondents include Bernard and Mary Berenson, Henri Bergson, Alfred Binet, John Dewey, G. Lowes Dickinson, John Galsworthy, William James, Arthur O. Lovejoy, John Masefield, G. E. Moore, Friedrich Paulsen (1 letter), Charles S. Peirce (2 letters), Ralph Barton Perry (2 letters), Walter Rauschenbusch, Bertrand Russell, George Santayana, F. C. S. Schiller, and Paul Shorey. Among his most faithful colleagues and critics were Durant Drake (Vassar College), Dickinson S. Miller (Columbia), James Bissett Pratt (Williams College), A. K. Rogers (Yale) and Roy Wood Sellars (University of Michigan). Strong's outgoing correspondence includes a packet entitled ""My Letters to Philosophers"" (1902-12).  George Santayana's correspondence with Strong, located in Series 2, is the largest single correspondence in the collection. The letters are uninterrupted for the period 1900 to 1939 and fill twenty folders. Most of the letters were written after 1912 during extended sojourns in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. Santayana's letters are warm and full of personal anecdote, and report on the books he is reading as well as the progress of his own writings, including ""The Realm of Matter"" (1930), ""The Realm of Truth"" (1937), ""The Realm of Spirit"" (1940), and the novel, ""The Last Puritan"" (1939). Although they remained loyal friends, Strong and Santayana continually disagreed over the scope and limits of perception. Their philosophical differences gradually took on a personal edge. After a 1938 meeting in Rome, which led to an altercation, Santayana wrote that he and Strong had fallen ""out of sympathy on almost every current subject."" In 1939, he declared, ""Your presuppositions as to what can and what cannot excite consciousness are not such as I feel any need of making."" Strong's letters to Santayana fill three folders and consist mainly of transcript drafts of letters for the years 1930, 1932 and 1933 concerning philosophical subjects.  The letters of William James to Charles Strong fill seven folders and are largely uninterrupted for the period 1898 to 1910, the year of James' death. In his letters, James discusses materialism, his reactions to Strong's writings, books he is reading, his teaching load, travel plans, family life, and the precarious state of his health. He describes in 1905 his first encounter with French philosopher Henri Bergson. Writing on 6 February 1906 from Palo Alto, where he was lecturing at Stanford University, he gives a lively account of his reaction to the San Francisco earthquake. Strong's letters to James fill one folder. Two letters (1889), written from Berlin, offer a theory of materialism explaining the relationship between the mind and the body, in which the human mind is a product of natural processes. Strong's theory found formal expression in his first book, ""Why the Mind has a Body"" (1903).  ",Charles Augustus Strong papers,,FA087,1961,"Open for research.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

Rockefeller (OMR). The office was located in Rockefeller Center on the 56th floor of the main building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, contemporaneously referred to as the RCA Building.   Mr. Rockefeller’s personal files begin with his formative years and education, documenting his early interest in science and his family’s extensive travels. But the focus of this record group is the 15 years following his service during World War II in the U.S. Army, when David Rockefeller was establishing himself in the arenas of banking, international business, and philanthropy. While his personal and philanthropic activities are well represented in the files, the business records of his 35-year career with Chase Bank are not part of this collection.  The largest portion of this record group comprises 21 boxes of personal correspondence that date from the immediate post-war period until 1961. Mostly unsolicited, these letters come from friends and acquaintances from across the globe and amply illustrate the vast range of relationships he cultivated through the years. Mr. Rockefeller often heard from individuals he met during his wartime service in France and Algiers—which was, in his own words, “the beginning of a networking process that I would follow throughout my life.”* Correspondents of note include Alfred Barr, Jr., Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Allen and John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dag Hammarskjold, General George C. Marshall, Robert Moses, Arthur Sulzberger, and William Zorach.  Personal correspondence with his parents, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, dates from 1925 until his graduation from Harvard University in 1936, and later with solely his father following Abby’s death in 1948. While there are a handful of files related to David Rockefeller’s wedding to Margaret McGrath and their honeymoon in Wyoming, there is no correspondence between the two prior to their marriage in 1940. Likewise, there is little to no correspondence with his sister and four brothers. Correspondence regarding his children remains closed to research during their respective lifetimes.  Among topics of note in this record group is David Rockefeller’s close association with Harvard University that spans several decades. This includes folders on his financial support of the institution, as well as his lengthy service on its Board of Overseers. Additionally, folders on his 25th class reunion in 1961—for which he was elected Chief Marshall of the event—are complemented by details of his efforts to mount a special art exhibition for the occasion. Other aspects of his lifelong love of art are evident in the folders on the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother co-founded and on whose board Mr. Rockefeller served starting in 1948. Furthermore, information on the origins of his own art collecting is found in Folders 210-217.  From a young age, David Rockefeller fully embraced his family’s tradition of extensive travel. His 1932 handwritten accounts of a biking trip in England before starting college detailed the summer adventure in letters home to his parents (Folder 437). In 1935, he toured dozens of European art museums with close friend Richard Gilder, his Harvard roommate who later died while serving as a combat pilot in World War II. During that trip, Richard wrote a particularly poignant letter to Abby Rockefeller that describes their summer travels through Europe and focuses on the ominous developments in Germany as the continent headed toward war (Folder 441).  Lastly, this record group includes personal and quasi-professional files from 1959 to 1981 that the Chase Manhattan Bank transferred to the family office following David Rockefeller’s retirement in 1981. These are mostly chronological, event-specific folders.  * Rockefeller, David, Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002, page 122.",David Rockefeller papers,,FA436,1985,"Open for research with select materials restricted as noted.

For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

7630af7862284e8e841bd5364c299209,Johns Hopkins University - Atlantic Studies - Evaluation,1981,,,American Cultural Heritage (series),,"In late 1970 the officers of the Rockefeller Foundation allocated $300,000 to launch a program of grants to individuals engaged in the study of America's ""cultural heritage."" The following year, they appropriated an additional $500,000 to support similar initiatives on an institutional level.  Taking shape in a time of political, social, and cultural ferment, the American Cultural Heritage Program broadly aspired to ""provide an alternative"" to the ""cynicism"" and ""self-doubt"" that seemed to characterize Americans' understanding of their nation and their past. The alternative the officers envisioned was no simple-minded recitation of American myths, but rather a careful and creative reexamination of America's heritage ""in the light of present problems."" Greater self-understanding would lead to greater ""awareness among Americans of their historical and cultural interdependence,"" a necessary first step to surmounting the problems that divided them. Such a critical reappraisal would also be a worthy contribution to the approaching national bicentennial commemoration.  The Cultural Heritage Program sought out promising younger scholars in the humanities and social sciences and particularly valued creative and interdisciplinary approaches. ""Intellectual excellence, broad social commitment, and an imaginative approach"" were the criteria that would guide institutional grants. With both the individual and institutional grants, the Foundation's goal was to ""make an important contribution to the self-understanding of America's populace,"" and then to help shape the future by disseminating these new views of the past through formal and informal educational programs.  The projects funded vary widely but are notable for the impetus they display to seek out new questions and new ways of answering them. The question of ""identities"" and the contributions of minorities to the American nation were primary areas of study. Grantees studied transitions in Alaskan Eskimo life, Emancipation Day celebrations, Chinese workers in Oregon, recent immigrant communities, the role of black religion, and the works of black and women writers. The grants favored projects that sought to apply new disciplines and new techniques to the consideration of American culture. Through oral histories and field research, historians and others used the tools of anthropology to understand their own society. Oral history projects documented labor unrest in the Midwest, southern politicians, and American music, among other topics. On an institutional level, American Cultural Heritage grants launched major centers for the study of Atlantic, Southern, and Appalachian history.  Film, television production, and photographic studies make up another segment of these grants. Projects funded include photographic studies of the American farm, of four Texas counties, of grassroots Christianity, and of blacks in America. Films on folk traditions and television productions on the history of a New England mill town and on the social history of technology in America also received support. The University of Iowa received funding for a program to integrate the study of film and American civilization.  While some projects, like the Atlantic Studies Center at Johns Hopkins University, received major funding and some grants went to well-established scholars and institutions, the foundation's concern to cast its grants widely is striking. In assessing a grant to collect a history of the Gros Ventre tribe, for example, the foundation officer noted that while they could look for someone with ""fancier credentials,"" they might also give ""direct and substantial encouragement"" to this ""diligent amateur."" The foundation also was concerned, in redressing the historical record, that the story be told by those who had lived it. The focus on oral history reflects this interest, but the concern was really a broader one to empower minorities to interpret their own heritage. Officers carefully considered a scholar's rapport with the community under study and gave extra weight to a shared regional or ethnic background. They favored one proposal, for example, because it presented the ""possibility of furthering Southern Studies by people from this region, in this region."" Some grants trained individuals in techniques that could then be brought back to the community.  The smallest grant - for $615 - allowed a scholar to complete a study of the black poet and novelist Jean Toomer. As the final grant report noted, people were impressed that ""of all the RF's worldwide activities, . . . we could still take time to make such a small grant for such an obscure project.""  While the American Cultural Heritage Program was a limited initiative, it is interesting to see the ways it intersected with and helped shape new initiatives in historical study. It encouraged interdisciplinary and particularly anthropological approaches to historical questions, supported the study of folklore, family history, religion, labor history, women's studies, community and regional studies, and embraced the application of new media to the presentation of traditional subjects. That these approaches are commonplace in textbooks today attests in some measure to the program's success. Researchers may also find in these files reflections of present-day concerns with cultural identity, heritage, and meaning.

Major correspondents include Abby's sister, Lucy Truman Aldrich, with whom Abby corresponded at length for thirty years; siblings Nelson, Edward, Stuart, William, Richard, Winthrop, and Elsie; and her six children: Abby (Babs), John Davison 3rd, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop, and David. The correspondence between Abby and David Rockefeller remains closed. For what survives of Abby's letters to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., consult the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Papers in Record Group 2, Series Z of the Rockefeller Family Archives.  Abby's correspondence with her brothers (Elsie Aldrich is not a primary correspondent) fills six folders. Letters reveal the friendly rapport and mutual respect that existed between the Aldrich siblings. They also provide information on Abby's occasional anonymous donations to projects in Boston and Providence for which her brothers sought her support. William, who was an architect in Boston, shared Abby's aesthetic interests and often recommended to her the purchase of paintings and furniture.  Among her children, Abby wrote most frequently to Winthrop Rockefeller, especially during the years of his army service (1941-1945) in World War II. Letters (1916-1948) from Babs to her mother include passionate appeals to return home from summer camp and accounts of sightseeing in Europe in 1920-1921 with her aunt, Lucy Truman Aldrich.  There are thirteen letters (1887-1909, n.d.) to Abby from her mother, Abby Pearce Chapman Aldrich. In a letter dated 8 March 1897, Mrs. Aldrich advises against a visit to New York, in case ""Mamma Rockaffller . . . think you are chasing her son."" Abby's letters to her mother are located in Subseries 5. There are thirteen letters (1887-1914, n.d.) to Abby from her father, Nelson W. Aldrich. Some are brief notes enclosed with checks; others display a rare sensitivity. Writing in the 1890s to his now teen-age daughter, the Senator acknowledges impending changes: ""Your letter reminds me that very soon I shall not be able to deal with you as a little girl to be disposed of without consultation but that you will have to be treated with as a young lady, with wants and demands.""  Other correspondents include Italianist Bernard Berenson, writing in 1927 from I Tatti; archaeologist James Henry Breasted, describing the recently unearthed tomb of King Tutankhamen; landscape architect Beatrice Ferrand, and painters Henri Matisse (two letters, 1932, 1933), Georgia O'Keefe, Walter Pach, and Peter Blume. Letters (1929-1937) from Eustache de Lorey of the Institut Français d'Archéologie et d'Art Musulmans discuss recent exhibitions, various pieces of Persian and Indian art, and modern pictures de Lorey envisioned for the Museum of Modern Art.  Also housed in Subseries 1 are twenty-four folders of Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) correspondence (1929-1945, 1947). This is largely Abby's incoming correspondence from museum staff relating to exhibitions and loans, personnel and financial matters, the War Veterans' Art Center, and modern movement in art. Major correspondents include Abby's financial adviser Arthur W. Packard, MoMA Director Alfred Barr, A. Conger Goodyear (President of MoMA), Monroe Wheeler (Director of Exhibitions and Publications), Stephen C. Clark (Chairman of the Board), Frances Hawkins (Secretary), James Thrall Soby (Director of Paintings and Sculpture), and John E. Abbott (Executive Vice President). Stephen Clark's moving tribute to Abby's moral leadership of the museum during the war years is housed in Subseries 7, Chase Biography Files, in folder 339.  The General Office File (1909-1955), a correspondence file maintained by John D.

Records concerning these latter grants are found, for the most part, not in the Grants series, but in the Organization Records series, under ""Grantmaking and Foundation History"" or under ""Spend-Down Process."" These late grants are grouped collectively rather than by individual grantee.  Grant files contain proposals, correspondence, and reports, and sometimes publications or literature relating to the institution or the particular grant. Most grant files also include one or more grant memos, which Taconic Foundation officers wrote for each new grant or renewal, setting forth for the board the terms of the request, the nature of the organization and its history with Taconic, previous funding, the pros and cons of the proposed grant, its fit with the Taconic program, and the recommended action.  The Taconic Foundation also funded a number of ""Projects"" that produced research and reports on issues of concern to the foundation or that resulted in the creation of new organizations that then benefited from Taconic grant support. Projects included, for example, the Assessment Project on Negro Needs, Davidoff's and Gold's proposals for low-income housing in lower Manhattan, the Voter Education Project, the Smokey House Project, and the Cooperative Assistance Fund.   A number of simple correspondence files are interspersed in this grants series. Each of these files generally contains just a few pieces of correspondence. While some correspondents have connections to Taconic projects, for the most part the correspondence files seem to be remnants of either a finite correspondence or a larger series. There is no general correspondence series in the Taconic records, and the Grants series constitutes the main series of files.  The Grants series is fairly comprehensive, but it is not a complete set of grant files. Some significant reports, such as Mary Conway Kohler's study of Youth and Work in New York, are not found in the files. Records are sparse or sometimes lacking for some of the Taconic Foundation's early grants. Many of the early programs were first launched with personal grants from the Curriers before the Taconic Foundation assumed their funding, and these hybrid origins may, perhaps, account for some of the gaps.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

The Council's lobbying efforts, including its response to the Tax Reform Act of 1969, are documented in the correspondence of Council executives David F. Freeman, Robert F. Goheen, and Eugene C. Struckhoff with politicians, members, and tax consultants that will be found throughout the series. Approximately 20 percent of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 dealt directly with foundations. The act, which extended and intensified Internal Revenue Service supervision of foundations and helped eliminate what some perceived as abuses in the management of foundations, had serious effects on foundations and on philanthropic giving. Files in this series discuss the impact or potential impact of changes in such areas as net investment income, self-dealing, excise taxes, and income accumulation regulations. Information on Internal Revenue Code revisions and the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 can also be found in this series.  Also housed here are files that offer insights into the Council's relationship with Congress. These files contain copies of proposed legislation in the House of Representatives and in the Senate; transcripts of House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee hearings; and correspondence with various members of Congress. Also included in the congressional files is a folder titled ""Investigations of Foundations"" (box 7, folder 61) that contains printed material regarding a number of congressional investigative committees, including the Special Committee to Investigate Tax Exempt Foundations (commonly known as the Reece Committee), whose chairman attempted in 1953-1954 to link foundations with the financing of communism in the United States.

Acme Oil Company; relations between executive and manufacturing committees; production; quality of oil; production of competitors.",Business (subseries),,"The business correspondence contains an avalanche of information about the far-flung activities of the Rockefeller empire. From all over the country and from around the world there flowed data, information, and rumor. Reports to the Executive Committee of Standard Oil showed how the firm dealt with the first really effective challenges to its international hegemony in the 1880s, the result of the discovery and exploitation of vast fields in Russia, developed by the Nobel interests. The task of keeping order in the industry was never-ending, as can be seen, for example, in the files from Standard executive John Archbold. The company's hold on the domestic transport of oil was threatened by a succession of competitors and opponents from time to time. For example, Archbold wrote to Rockefeller in 1886: ""We learn today to our great surprise and disgust that Penna. RR is furnishing Tank cars to the Holdship pipe Line for shipment of crude oil East. Have telegraphed protest strongly.""* Similarly, the international struggle required constant vigilance: ""We are considering the question of sending somebody to the Far East . . . the Russians are making very aggressive efforts in these mkts.""** By contrast, at moments when all was well within Standard's empire, Archbold could report what Rockefeller longed to hear: ""pressing sales of refined in all directions as vigorously as possible. Everything moving along quietly and well.""***   Equally important were the continuous summaries of quantitative data, the informational lifeblood of a modern business enterprise. Reports on stocks of crude oil, kerosene, and lubricants came constantly from New Jersey, from Marseilles, from the Far East, and from all over the world. Data on productivity and profitability were especially prevalent, such as reports on the monthly yields of various products per hundred gallons of crude in Standard's different refineries around the country, including conclusions about the total value of the product, the cost of refining, and the net value of goods produced at each site. No detail seemed to be too small to require at least a summary for the firm's head, including data on the monthly amounts paid to Western Union in Cleveland for telegrams. Information on insurance, news of competitors' new or rumored refineries or transportation facilities, measures of performance by individual managers or refineries, real estate deals, and political and legal intelligence were generated in staggering volume. Important moments in history are here, such as the telegram from Standard's lawyer and lobbyist in Washington that brought John D. Rockefeller word of Senate passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. ""Senate has just passed the Judiciary Committee trust bill all amendments being voted down,"" J. H. Flagg wired Rockefeller at his residence at 4 W. 54th Street in Manhattan in April of 1890. ""There was but little debate and only one Senator Blodgett of New Jersey voted against the bill.""**** A little more than twenty years later, that act would be used to break up Standard Oil in the landmark Supreme Court case of 1911.   In these voluminous business files we see also the communications to their leader from many of the able lieutenants and associates in Standard, such as John Archbold, Henry Flagler, and Henry Folger. Here, in short, we can see the details of how the great Standard Oil Trust did its work.

Records concerning these latter grants are found, for the most part, not in the Grants series, but in the Organization Records series, under ""Grantmaking and Foundation History"" or under ""Spend-Down Process."" These late grants are grouped collectively rather than by individual grantee.  Grant files contain proposals, correspondence, and reports, and sometimes publications or literature relating to the institution or the particular grant. Most grant files also include one or more grant memos, which Taconic Foundation officers wrote for each new grant or renewal, setting forth for the board the terms of the request, the nature of the organization and its history with Taconic, previous funding, the pros and cons of the proposed grant, its fit with the Taconic program, and the recommended action.  The Taconic Foundation also funded a number of ""Projects"" that produced research and reports on issues of concern to the foundation or that resulted in the creation of new organizations that then benefited from Taconic grant support. Projects included, for example, the Assessment Project on Negro Needs, Davidoff's and Gold's proposals for low-income housing in lower Manhattan, the Voter Education Project, the Smokey House Project, and the Cooperative Assistance Fund.   A number of simple correspondence files are interspersed in this grants series. Each of these files generally contains just a few pieces of correspondence. While some correspondents have connections to Taconic projects, for the most part the correspondence files seem to be remnants of either a finite correspondence or a larger series. There is no general correspondence series in the Taconic records, and the Grants series constitutes the main series of files.  The Grants series is fairly comprehensive, but it is not a complete set of grant files. Some significant reports, such as Mary Conway Kohler's study of Youth and Work in New York, are not found in the files. Records are sparse or sometimes lacking for some of the Taconic Foundation's early grants. Many of the early programs were first launched with personal grants from the Curriers before the Taconic Foundation assumed their funding, and these hybrid origins may, perhaps, account for some of the gaps.

The Rockefeller Foundation diaries are an incomplete set and are draft versions of the final diaries filed with the Rockefeller Foundation and found in their archives.  The drafts do not appear to differ significantly from the final versions.  Of interest in this series is Fahs’s report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.  Researchers interested in the early career of Charles Burton Fahs should also explore the correspondence files in Series 1 dated from this period; during his early career, there was an overlap between Fahs’s personal and professional life.

Rockefeller was deeply concerned about the need for increasing America's understanding and appreciation of the peoples of Asia. To that end, he was involved in the support of cultural exchange programs; the revival of the Japan Society; the formation of the Asia Society; the construction of Asia House, the Asia Society's New York City headquarters; and the construction of the International House of Japan in Tokyo. The files documenting the teaching of the English language in Japan (folders 452-455) reflect Rockefeller's belief in the importance of English to Japan's growth in the international community. Also included here are files relating to the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. (CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478). Also represented here are two commercial ventures developed by Rockefeller to sell in the United States quality merchandise manufactured in Asia, namely, Products of Asia, Inc. and Products of India, Inc.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council. Most of the files in this section are from the 30's and 40's.   Directors of the social science program were Edmund E. Day (1929-1937), Sydnor H. Walker, Acting (1937-1938), and Joseph H.

Roosevelt that expressed concern over Nazi influence in that region and recommended a program of U.S. cooperation and assistance to raise the standard of living in Latin America and to improve relations between the nations of the western hemisphere. President Roosevelt responded by appointing Rockefeller to head a new program that became the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the agency coordinated the strategic defense of the region in the fields of information, economics, health, sanitation, agriculture, transportation, and culture and actively worked to frustrate Axis propaganda campaigns and economic designs on Latin America.

Acme Oil Company; relations between executive and manufacturing committees; production; quality of oil; production of competitors.",Business (subseries),,"The business correspondence contains an avalanche of information about the far-flung activities of the Rockefeller empire. From all over the country and from around the world there flowed data, information, and rumor. Reports to the Executive Committee of Standard Oil showed how the firm dealt with the first really effective challenges to its international hegemony in the 1880s, the result of the discovery and exploitation of vast fields in Russia, developed by the Nobel interests. The task of keeping order in the industry was never-ending, as can be seen, for example, in the files from Standard executive John Archbold. The company's hold on the domestic transport of oil was threatened by a succession of competitors and opponents from time to time. For example, Archbold wrote to Rockefeller in 1886: ""We learn today to our great surprise and disgust that Penna. RR is furnishing Tank cars to the Holdship pipe Line for shipment of crude oil East. Have telegraphed protest strongly.""* Similarly, the international struggle required constant vigilance: ""We are considering the question of sending somebody to the Far East . . . the Russians are making very aggressive efforts in these mkts.""** By contrast, at moments when all was well within Standard's empire, Archbold could report what Rockefeller longed to hear: ""pressing sales of refined in all directions as vigorously as possible. Everything moving along quietly and well.""***   Equally important were the continuous summaries of quantitative data, the informational lifeblood of a modern business enterprise. Reports on stocks of crude oil, kerosene, and lubricants came constantly from New Jersey, from Marseilles, from the Far East, and from all over the world. Data on productivity and profitability were especially prevalent, such as reports on the monthly yields of various products per hundred gallons of crude in Standard's different refineries around the country, including conclusions about the total value of the product, the cost of refining, and the net value of goods produced at each site. No detail seemed to be too small to require at least a summary for the firm's head, including data on the monthly amounts paid to Western Union in Cleveland for telegrams. Information on insurance, news of competitors' new or rumored refineries or transportation facilities, measures of performance by individual managers or refineries, real estate deals, and political and legal intelligence were generated in staggering volume. Important moments in history are here, such as the telegram from Standard's lawyer and lobbyist in Washington that brought John D. Rockefeller word of Senate passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. ""Senate has just passed the Judiciary Committee trust bill all amendments being voted down,"" J. H. Flagg wired Rockefeller at his residence at 4 W. 54th Street in Manhattan in April of 1890. ""There was but little debate and only one Senator Blodgett of New Jersey voted against the bill.""**** A little more than twenty years later, that act would be used to break up Standard Oil in the landmark Supreme Court case of 1911.   In these voluminous business files we see also the communications to their leader from many of the able lieutenants and associates in Standard, such as John Archbold, Henry Flagler, and Henry Folger. Here, in short, we can see the details of how the great Standard Oil Trust did its work.

49773c2f15aa4bb4b4b17f699b626c61,Johns Hopkins University - Atlantic Studies,1972,,,American Cultural Heritage (series),,"In late 1970 the officers of the Rockefeller Foundation allocated $300,000 to launch a program of grants to individuals engaged in the study of America's ""cultural heritage."" The following year, they appropriated an additional $500,000 to support similar initiatives on an institutional level.  Taking shape in a time of political, social, and cultural ferment, the American Cultural Heritage Program broadly aspired to ""provide an alternative"" to the ""cynicism"" and ""self-doubt"" that seemed to characterize Americans' understanding of their nation and their past. The alternative the officers envisioned was no simple-minded recitation of American myths, but rather a careful and creative reexamination of America's heritage ""in the light of present problems."" Greater self-understanding would lead to greater ""awareness among Americans of their historical and cultural interdependence,"" a necessary first step to surmounting the problems that divided them. Such a critical reappraisal would also be a worthy contribution to the approaching national bicentennial commemoration.  The Cultural Heritage Program sought out promising younger scholars in the humanities and social sciences and particularly valued creative and interdisciplinary approaches. ""Intellectual excellence, broad social commitment, and an imaginative approach"" were the criteria that would guide institutional grants. With both the individual and institutional grants, the Foundation's goal was to ""make an important contribution to the self-understanding of America's populace,"" and then to help shape the future by disseminating these new views of the past through formal and informal educational programs.  The projects funded vary widely but are notable for the impetus they display to seek out new questions and new ways of answering them. The question of ""identities"" and the contributions of minorities to the American nation were primary areas of study. Grantees studied transitions in Alaskan Eskimo life, Emancipation Day celebrations, Chinese workers in Oregon, recent immigrant communities, the role of black religion, and the works of black and women writers. The grants favored projects that sought to apply new disciplines and new techniques to the consideration of American culture. Through oral histories and field research, historians and others used the tools of anthropology to understand their own society. Oral history projects documented labor unrest in the Midwest, southern politicians, and American music, among other topics. On an institutional level, American Cultural Heritage grants launched major centers for the study of Atlantic, Southern, and Appalachian history.  Film, television production, and photographic studies make up another segment of these grants. Projects funded include photographic studies of the American farm, of four Texas counties, of grassroots Christianity, and of blacks in America. Films on folk traditions and television productions on the history of a New England mill town and on the social history of technology in America also received support. The University of Iowa received funding for a program to integrate the study of film and American civilization.  While some projects, like the Atlantic Studies Center at Johns Hopkins University, received major funding and some grants went to well-established scholars and institutions, the foundation's concern to cast its grants widely is striking. In assessing a grant to collect a history of the Gros Ventre tribe, for example, the foundation officer noted that while they could look for someone with ""fancier credentials,"" they might also give ""direct and substantial encouragement"" to this ""diligent amateur."" The foundation also was concerned, in redressing the historical record, that the story be told by those who had lived it. The focus on oral history reflects this interest, but the concern was really a broader one to empower minorities to interpret their own heritage. Officers carefully considered a scholar's rapport with the community under study and gave extra weight to a shared regional or ethnic background. They favored one proposal, for example, because it presented the ""possibility of furthering Southern Studies by people from this region, in this region."" Some grants trained individuals in techniques that could then be brought back to the community.  The smallest grant - for $615 - allowed a scholar to complete a study of the black poet and novelist Jean Toomer. As the final grant report noted, people were impressed that ""of all the RF's worldwide activities, . . . we could still take time to make such a small grant for such an obscure project.""  While the American Cultural Heritage Program was a limited initiative, it is interesting to see the ways it intersected with and helped shape new initiatives in historical study. It encouraged interdisciplinary and particularly anthropological approaches to historical questions, supported the study of folklore, family history, religion, labor history, women's studies, community and regional studies, and embraced the application of new media to the presentation of traditional subjects. That these approaches are commonplace in textbooks today attests in some measure to the program's success. Researchers may also find in these files reflections of present-day concerns with cultural identity, heritage, and meaning.

Strong's correspondents include Bernard and Mary Berenson, Henri Bergson, Alfred Binet, John Dewey, G. Lowes Dickinson, John Galsworthy, William James, Arthur O. Lovejoy, John Masefield, G. E. Moore, Friedrich Paulsen (1 letter), Charles S. Peirce (2 letters), Ralph Barton Perry (2 letters), Walter Rauschenbusch, Bertrand Russell, George Santayana, F. C. S. Schiller, and Paul Shorey. Among his most faithful colleagues and critics were Durant Drake (Vassar College), Dickinson S. Miller (Columbia), James Bissett Pratt (Williams College), A. K. Rogers (Yale) and Roy Wood Sellars (University of Michigan). Strong's outgoing correspondence includes a packet entitled ""My Letters to Philosophers"" (1902-12).  George Santayana's correspondence with Strong, located in Series 2, is the largest single correspondence in the collection. The letters are uninterrupted for the period 1900 to 1939 and fill twenty folders. Most of the letters were written after 1912 during extended sojourns in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. Santayana's letters are warm and full of personal anecdote, and report on the books he is reading as well as the progress of his own writings, including ""The Realm of Matter"" (1930), ""The Realm of Truth"" (1937), ""The Realm of Spirit"" (1940), and the novel, ""The Last Puritan"" (1939). Although they remained loyal friends, Strong and Santayana continually disagreed over the scope and limits of perception. Their philosophical differences gradually took on a personal edge. After a 1938 meeting in Rome, which led to an altercation, Santayana wrote that he and Strong had fallen ""out of sympathy on almost every current subject."" In 1939, he declared, ""Your presuppositions as to what can and what cannot excite consciousness are not such as I feel any need of making."" Strong's letters to Santayana fill three folders and consist mainly of transcript drafts of letters for the years 1930, 1932 and 1933 concerning philosophical subjects.  The letters of William James to Charles Strong fill seven folders and are largely uninterrupted for the period 1898 to 1910, the year of James' death. In his letters, James discusses materialism, his reactions to Strong's writings, books he is reading, his teaching load, travel plans, family life, and the precarious state of his health. He describes in 1905 his first encounter with French philosopher Henri Bergson. Writing on 6 February 1906 from Palo Alto, where he was lecturing at Stanford University, he gives a lively account of his reaction to the San Francisco earthquake. Strong's letters to James fill one folder. Two letters (1889), written from Berlin, offer a theory of materialism explaining the relationship between the mind and the body, in which the human mind is a product of natural processes.

The files documenting the teaching of the English language in Japan (folders 452-455) reflect Rockefeller's belief in the importance of English to Japan's growth in the international community.

(CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478).

Geithner’s engagement with various China-related issues during the periods he served as Ford Foundation Representative for China (1988-1990) and Regional Director for Asia Programs (1990-1996). Most of the material consists of newspaper clippings, journal articles, reports, and conference papers, amongst an array of other types of publications and press. These records discuss such topics as economic and political reforms in China, China’s international relations and foreign policy (mostly focused on U.S.-China relations), environmental issues and sustainable development, agricultural development, legal system reform, pro-democracy movements, and government repression of intellectuals and political dissidents. Media coverage and academic analysis of the student-led protests at Tiananmen Square and the June Fourth Incident are featured prominently within the subseries as are the coverage and analysis of the international response to the events and China’s subsequent economic and political trajectory. A few pieces of correspondence from Geithner help to relay his perspective on the incidents. He wrote the letters in May 1989 to family members as well as to the Ford Office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, just days before the violence occurred.   Although the subseries does not include many documents that reveal the Ford Foundation’s specific program activities in China during the times that Geithner was China Representative or Regional Director for Asia Programs, Geithner’s accumulation of these articles and reports suggests that he used these sources to inform his outlook on numerous issues affecting China as well as his program decisions for Ford’s activities in the country. There are notes that indicate he requested the material as well as notes that show he received it from colleagues and personal relations who believed that he would be interested in the content. Moreover, Geithner added notes and annotations to many of the papers and articles.

Kissinger and Vance co-chaired the organization, which consisted of 35-40 Directors – business executives or former government leaders – who shared interest in China. According to its statement of purpose, “the America-China Society works to increase understanding between the United States and the PRC; to advance diplomatic, commercial, cultural, social, scientific and educational ties; to foster public policies which promote their shared interests; to enhance opportunities for United States enterprises to engage in mutually beneficial investment and trade with the PRC; and to cooperate with governmental and private organizations having comparable objectives.” In January 2000, the ACS directors voted to merge with the National Committee, becoming (around 2001), the America-China Forum of the National Committee on U. S. – China Relations.   The ACS/ACF records in this series consist of Executive Directors correspondence, 1988 – 1999; Directors correspondence, late 1980s – 1990s, and correspondence with Individuals, mid- to late 1990s; organizational records and meeting minutes and materials, 1986 – 2000; records of ACS programs and events; ACS Trip files; and various office files. While some of the meeting, trip, and event files include remarks or notes by Kissinger, materials in the correspondence files pertaining to Kissinger consist mainly of informational memos to him (with marginal responses) or prepared letters.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.

Rockefeller (OMR). The office was located in Rockefeller Center on the 56th floor of the main building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, contemporaneously referred to as the RCA Building.   Mr. Rockefeller’s personal files begin with his formative years and education, documenting his early interest in science and his family’s extensive travels. But the focus of this record group is the 15 years following his service during World War II in the U.S. Army, when David Rockefeller was establishing himself in the arenas of banking, international business, and philanthropy. While his personal and philanthropic activities are well represented in the files, the business records of his 35-year career with Chase Bank are not part of this collection.  The largest portion of this record group comprises 21 boxes of personal correspondence that date from the immediate post-war period until 1961. Mostly unsolicited, these letters come from friends and acquaintances from across the globe and amply illustrate the vast range of relationships he cultivated through the years. Mr. Rockefeller often heard from individuals he met during his wartime service in France and Algiers—which was, in his own words, “the beginning of a networking process that I would follow throughout my life.”* Correspondents of note include Alfred Barr, Jr., Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Allen and John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dag Hammarskjold, General George C. Marshall, Robert Moses, Arthur Sulzberger, and William Zorach.  Personal correspondence with his parents, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, dates from 1925 until his graduation from Harvard University in 1936, and later with solely his father following Abby’s death in 1948. While there are a handful of files related to David Rockefeller’s wedding to Margaret McGrath and their honeymoon in Wyoming, there is no correspondence between the two prior to their marriage in 1940. Likewise, there is little to no correspondence with his sister and four brothers. Correspondence regarding his children remains closed to research during their respective lifetimes.  Among topics of note in this record group is David Rockefeller’s close association with Harvard University that spans several decades. This includes folders on his financial support of the institution, as well as his lengthy service on its Board of Overseers. Additionally, folders on his 25th class reunion in 1961—for which he was elected Chief Marshall of the event—are complemented by details of his efforts to mount a special art exhibition for the occasion. Other aspects of his lifelong love of art are evident in the folders on the Museum of Modern Art, which his mother co-founded and on whose board Mr. Rockefeller served starting in 1948. Furthermore, information on the origins of his own art collecting is found in Folders 210-217.  From a young age, David Rockefeller fully embraced his family’s tradition of extensive travel. His 1932 handwritten accounts of a biking trip in England before starting college detailed the summer adventure in letters home to his parents (Folder 437). In 1935, he toured dozens of European art museums with close friend Richard Gilder, his Harvard roommate who later died while serving as a combat pilot in World War II. During that trip, Richard wrote a particularly poignant letter to Abby Rockefeller that describes their summer travels through Europe and focuses on the ominous developments in Germany as the continent headed toward war (Folder 441).  Lastly, this record group includes personal and quasi-professional files from 1959 to 1981 that the Chase Manhattan Bank transferred to the family office following David Rockefeller’s retirement in 1981. These are mostly chronological, event-specific folders.  * Rockefeller, David, Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002, page 122.",David Rockefeller papers,,FA436,1985,"Open for research with select materials restricted as noted.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution.

2fafe6748461489280c3a18e9222b91d,Johns Hopkins University - Atlantic Studies,1974,,,American Cultural Heritage (series),,"In late 1970 the officers of the Rockefeller Foundation allocated $300,000 to launch a program of grants to individuals engaged in the study of America's ""cultural heritage."" The following year, they appropriated an additional $500,000 to support similar initiatives on an institutional level.  Taking shape in a time of political, social, and cultural ferment, the American Cultural Heritage Program broadly aspired to ""provide an alternative"" to the ""cynicism"" and ""self-doubt"" that seemed to characterize Americans' understanding of their nation and their past. The alternative the officers envisioned was no simple-minded recitation of American myths, but rather a careful and creative reexamination of America's heritage ""in the light of present problems."" Greater self-understanding would lead to greater ""awareness among Americans of their historical and cultural interdependence,"" a necessary first step to surmounting the problems that divided them. Such a critical reappraisal would also be a worthy contribution to the approaching national bicentennial commemoration.  The Cultural Heritage Program sought out promising younger scholars in the humanities and social sciences and particularly valued creative and interdisciplinary approaches. ""Intellectual excellence, broad social commitment, and an imaginative approach"" were the criteria that would guide institutional grants. With both the individual and institutional grants, the Foundation's goal was to ""make an important contribution to the self-understanding of America's populace,"" and then to help shape the future by disseminating these new views of the past through formal and informal educational programs.  The projects funded vary widely but are notable for the impetus they display to seek out new questions and new ways of answering them. The question of ""identities"" and the contributions of minorities to the American nation were primary areas of study. Grantees studied transitions in Alaskan Eskimo life, Emancipation Day celebrations, Chinese workers in Oregon, recent immigrant communities, the role of black religion, and the works of black and women writers. The grants favored projects that sought to apply new disciplines and new techniques to the consideration of American culture. Through oral histories and field research, historians and others used the tools of anthropology to understand their own society. Oral history projects documented labor unrest in the Midwest, southern politicians, and American music, among other topics. On an institutional level, American Cultural Heritage grants launched major centers for the study of Atlantic, Southern, and Appalachian history.  Film, television production, and photographic studies make up another segment of these grants. Projects funded include photographic studies of the American farm, of four Texas counties, of grassroots Christianity, and of blacks in America. Films on folk traditions and television productions on the history of a New England mill town and on the social history of technology in America also received support. The University of Iowa received funding for a program to integrate the study of film and American civilization.  While some projects, like the Atlantic Studies Center at Johns Hopkins University, received major funding and some grants went to well-established scholars and institutions, the foundation's concern to cast its grants widely is striking. In assessing a grant to collect a history of the Gros Ventre tribe, for example, the foundation officer noted that while they could look for someone with ""fancier credentials,"" they might also give ""direct and substantial encouragement"" to this ""diligent amateur."" The foundation also was concerned, in redressing the historical record, that the story be told by those who had lived it. The focus on oral history reflects this interest, but the concern was really a broader one to empower minorities to interpret their own heritage. Officers carefully considered a scholar's rapport with the community under study and gave extra weight to a shared regional or ethnic background. They favored one proposal, for example, because it presented the ""possibility of furthering Southern Studies by people from this region, in this region."" Some grants trained individuals in techniques that could then be brought back to the community.  The smallest grant - for $615 - allowed a scholar to complete a study of the black poet and novelist Jean Toomer. As the final grant report noted, people were impressed that ""of all the RF's worldwide activities, . . . we could still take time to make such a small grant for such an obscure project.""  While the American Cultural Heritage Program was a limited initiative, it is interesting to see the ways it intersected with and helped shape new initiatives in historical study. It encouraged interdisciplinary and particularly anthropological approaches to historical questions, supported the study of folklore, family history, religion, labor history, women's studies, community and regional studies, and embraced the application of new media to the presentation of traditional subjects. That these approaches are commonplace in textbooks today attests in some measure to the program's success. Researchers may also find in these files reflections of present-day concerns with cultural identity, heritage, and meaning.

The Foundation's program in the medical sciences during this period was directed by Dr. Alan Gregg and was concentrated in psychiatry and neurology and related subjects - neuroanatomy, heredity, endocrinology, neuropathology, child guidance, industrial psychology and sex research. Emphasis was placed on worker training, selected research projects and measures to improve or extend the application of existing knowledge. The medical sciences program also devoted part of its resources to the development of university teaching departments of public health. The program was conceived to be complementary to the natural sciences program in human biology. Although it developed out of the old Division of Medical Education of the Foundation, the Medical Sciences division had no program in medical education in the United States, except for a small program of post-war medical fellowship grants to leading universities. | For information about the establishment of medical schools see the files of the General Education Board.

Edward Capps, director in 1929-1930, administered a program concentrating on teaching and research in classical studies, emphasizing fluid research funds. For two years humanities was without a director until David H. Stevens was appointed in 1932. Subsequently a new program was developed emphasizing improved world communication through national libraries and teaching of essential languages. In early years 1932-1939, this program was concentrated on four main geographical areas - the Far East, Latin America, the Slavic region and the United States. Support was also given to early experiments in microfilm and radio research.   During the war years, 1939-1945, early experience in mass communication proved valuable, and support was given for work in microfilm, especially for preservation of endangered records, for radio listening centers and propaganda analysis, and public opinion polling. Language training continued to be important. European humanists were aided in their efforts to reach this country and resume productive lives.   After 1945, although support for Far East and Slavic studies continued, there was a new emphasis on America in the Foundation's program, seen in grants for regional studies and grants in aid of American scholarly publishing.   Humanities in creative aspects had support chiefly in the advance of community and university drama. A substantial grant was made to start the Berkshire Music Center.   Mostly material from the 1930's - 1950's. David H. Stevens remained director of the humanities program until 1950.

240de2aef8c14d1f8c3705bd4422c1ea,Johns Hopkins University - Atlantic Studies,1981,,,American Cultural Heritage (series),,"In late 1970 the officers of the Rockefeller Foundation allocated $300,000 to launch a program of grants to individuals engaged in the study of America's ""cultural heritage."" The following year, they appropriated an additional $500,000 to support similar initiatives on an institutional level.  Taking shape in a time of political, social, and cultural ferment, the American Cultural Heritage Program broadly aspired to ""provide an alternative"" to the ""cynicism"" and ""self-doubt"" that seemed to characterize Americans' understanding of their nation and their past. The alternative the officers envisioned was no simple-minded recitation of American myths, but rather a careful and creative reexamination of America's heritage ""in the light of present problems."" Greater self-understanding would lead to greater ""awareness among Americans of their historical and cultural interdependence,"" a necessary first step to surmounting the problems that divided them. Such a critical reappraisal would also be a worthy contribution to the approaching national bicentennial commemoration.  The Cultural Heritage Program sought out promising younger scholars in the humanities and social sciences and particularly valued creative and interdisciplinary approaches. ""Intellectual excellence, broad social commitment, and an imaginative approach"" were the criteria that would guide institutional grants. With both the individual and institutional grants, the Foundation's goal was to ""make an important contribution to the self-understanding of America's populace,"" and then to help shape the future by disseminating these new views of the past through formal and informal educational programs.  The projects funded vary widely but are notable for the impetus they display to seek out new questions and new ways of answering them. The question of ""identities"" and the contributions of minorities to the American nation were primary areas of study. Grantees studied transitions in Alaskan Eskimo life, Emancipation Day celebrations, Chinese workers in Oregon, recent immigrant communities, the role of black religion, and the works of black and women writers. The grants favored projects that sought to apply new disciplines and new techniques to the consideration of American culture. Through oral histories and field research, historians and others used the tools of anthropology to understand their own society. Oral history projects documented labor unrest in the Midwest, southern politicians, and American music, among other topics. On an institutional level, American Cultural Heritage grants launched major centers for the study of Atlantic, Southern, and Appalachian history.  Film, television production, and photographic studies make up another segment of these grants. Projects funded include photographic studies of the American farm, of four Texas counties, of grassroots Christianity, and of blacks in America. Films on folk traditions and television productions on the history of a New England mill town and on the social history of technology in America also received support. The University of Iowa received funding for a program to integrate the study of film and American civilization.  While some projects, like the Atlantic Studies Center at Johns Hopkins University, received major funding and some grants went to well-established scholars and institutions, the foundation's concern to cast its grants widely is striking. In assessing a grant to collect a history of the Gros Ventre tribe, for example, the foundation officer noted that while they could look for someone with ""fancier credentials,"" they might also give ""direct and substantial encouragement"" to this ""diligent amateur."" The foundation also was concerned, in redressing the historical record, that the story be told by those who had lived it. The focus on oral history reflects this interest, but the concern was really a broader one to empower minorities to interpret their own heritage. Officers carefully considered a scholar's rapport with the community under study and gave extra weight to a shared regional or ethnic background. They favored one proposal, for example, because it presented the ""possibility of furthering Southern Studies by people from this region, in this region."" Some grants trained individuals in techniques that could then be brought back to the community.  The smallest grant - for $615 - allowed a scholar to complete a study of the black poet and novelist Jean Toomer. As the final grant report noted, people were impressed that ""of all the RF's worldwide activities, . . . we could still take time to make such a small grant for such an obscure project.""  While the American Cultural Heritage Program was a limited initiative, it is interesting to see the ways it intersected with and helped shape new initiatives in historical study. It encouraged interdisciplinary and particularly anthropological approaches to historical questions, supported the study of folklore, family history, religion, labor history, women's studies, community and regional studies, and embraced the application of new media to the presentation of traditional subjects. That these approaches are commonplace in textbooks today attests in some measure to the program's success. Researchers may also find in these files reflections of present-day concerns with cultural identity, heritage, and meaning.

Rockefeller, Jr., Personal Papers - Speeches (subseries)",,"John D. Rockefeller, Jr. became well known for his Bible class lessons. Speeches demonstrate his theological classes first took place (1894) at the YMCA when JDR Jr. was a student at Brown University. After graduation from Brown, JDR Jr. became affiliated with his father at 26 Broadway, New York City. He participated actively as a member of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, and there, for a period of 10 years, conducted a Young Man's Bible Class. A number of these Bible class lessons are included in the speech file. A majority of the speeches he delivered throughout his life echo the religious themes he developed during his years as a Bible class teacher.  JDR Jr. gradually eased out of much of the family business and turned his attention and dedication to philanthropic endeavors. The speech file richly reveals the causes JDR Jr. espoused. His keen interest in the arts prompted such undertakings as the erection of The Cloisters and Rockefeller Center. Rockefeller contributions, under the direction of JDR Jr., formed the basis for the restoration projects of Williamsburg, Virginia, and several historic properties in Westchester County, New York. JDR Jr.'s interest in historical preservation extended beyond the United States. He became deeply involved in the restoration projects of the Palace of Versailles, Fontainebleau, and the cathedral of Rheims.  JDR Jr. was a key supporter, during both world wars, of service organizations that would benefit and build morale among the United States servicemen. A number of speeches reflect this interest.  As chairman of the General Education Board and the International Education Board, education was a prime source of interest to JDR Jr. He sought the betterment of men and women through education both in the United States and abroad. Most prominent in the speech subseries is JDR Jr.'s work on behalf of the United Negro College Fund Campaign and the establishment of the Peking Union Medical College.  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. firmly believed in promoting greater understanding between labor and capital. He, with the able guidance of Mackenzie King, sought to establish workable partnerships between labor and capital. The speech file contains many of the speeches he delivered on this subject.  Each speech is assigned to one of the following 10 subject areas: Brotherhood, Education, Fund, Labor, Personal, Religion, Restoration, Social Welfare, Stewardship, Tribute.  Subject areas were assigned by the General Files staff and the processing archivist.  Other information in each entry includes: Title (assigned by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), Institution (or group to whom the speech was given), Occasion (reason for the speech), Place (geographic location), Format (includes handwritten outline, typed, magazine article, printed pamphlet).",Office of the Messrs.

Major colleges and universities across the U.S., as well as many small institutions in every state, received aid from the Board. The emphasis, however, was on the South and the education of Blacks. Offices were established in Richmond, Virginia, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to give GEB agents closer contact with southern communities. The Board was especially active in promoting the public school movement in the early part of the twentieth century. After 1940, programs other than those for southern education were brought to a close; funds were nearly exhausted by the 1950s, and the last appropriation was made in 1964.",General Education Board records,,FA058,1969,Open for research with select materials restricted are noted.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council. Most of the files in this section are from the 30's and 40's.   Directors of the social science program were Edmund E. Day (1929-1937), Sydnor H. Walker, Acting (1937-1938), and Joseph H.

Rockefeller, Jr., Personal Papers - Speeches (subseries)",,"John D. Rockefeller, Jr. became well known for his Bible class lessons. Speeches demonstrate his theological classes first took place (1894) at the YMCA when JDR Jr. was a student at Brown University. After graduation from Brown, JDR Jr. became affiliated with his father at 26 Broadway, New York City. He participated actively as a member of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, and there, for a period of 10 years, conducted a Young Man's Bible Class. A number of these Bible class lessons are included in the speech file. A majority of the speeches he delivered throughout his life echo the religious themes he developed during his years as a Bible class teacher.  JDR Jr. gradually eased out of much of the family business and turned his attention and dedication to philanthropic endeavors. The speech file richly reveals the causes JDR Jr. espoused. His keen interest in the arts prompted such undertakings as the erection of The Cloisters and Rockefeller Center. Rockefeller contributions, under the direction of JDR Jr., formed the basis for the restoration projects of Williamsburg, Virginia, and several historic properties in Westchester County, New York. JDR Jr.'s interest in historical preservation extended beyond the United States. He became deeply involved in the restoration projects of the Palace of Versailles, Fontainebleau, and the cathedral of Rheims.  JDR Jr. was a key supporter, during both world wars, of service organizations that would benefit and build morale among the United States servicemen. A number of speeches reflect this interest.  As chairman of the General Education Board and the International Education Board, education was a prime source of interest to JDR Jr. He sought the betterment of men and women through education both in the United States and abroad. Most prominent in the speech subseries is JDR Jr.'s work on behalf of the United Negro College Fund Campaign and the establishment of the Peking Union Medical College.  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. firmly believed in promoting greater understanding between labor and capital. He, with the able guidance of Mackenzie King, sought to establish workable partnerships between labor and capital. The speech file contains many of the speeches he delivered on this subject.  Each speech is assigned to one of the following 10 subject areas: Brotherhood, Education, Fund, Labor, Personal, Religion, Restoration, Social Welfare, Stewardship, Tribute.  Subject areas were assigned by the General Files staff and the processing archivist.  Other information in each entry includes: Title (assigned by John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), Institution (or group to whom the speech was given), Occasion (reason for the speech), Place (geographic location), Format (includes handwritten outline, typed, magazine article, printed pamphlet).",Office of the Messrs.

Rockefeller was deeply concerned about the need for increasing America's understanding and appreciation of the peoples of Asia. To that end, he was involved in the support of cultural exchange programs; the revival of the Japan Society; the formation of the Asia Society; the construction of Asia House, the Asia Society's New York City headquarters; and the construction of the International House of Japan in Tokyo. The files documenting the teaching of the English language in Japan (folders 452-455) reflect Rockefeller's belief in the importance of English to Japan's growth in the international community. Also included here are files relating to the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. (CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478).

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council. Most of the files in this section are from the 30's and 40's.   Directors of the social science program were Edmund E. Day (1929-1937), Sydnor H. Walker, Acting (1937-1938), and Joseph H.

Strong's correspondents include Bernard and Mary Berenson, Henri Bergson, Alfred Binet, John Dewey, G. Lowes Dickinson, John Galsworthy, William James, Arthur O. Lovejoy, John Masefield, G. E. Moore, Friedrich Paulsen (1 letter), Charles S. Peirce (2 letters), Ralph Barton Perry (2 letters), Walter Rauschenbusch, Bertrand Russell, George Santayana, F. C. S. Schiller, and Paul Shorey. Among his most faithful colleagues and critics were Durant Drake (Vassar College), Dickinson S. Miller (Columbia), James Bissett Pratt (Williams College), A. K. Rogers (Yale) and Roy Wood Sellars (University of Michigan). Strong's outgoing correspondence includes a packet entitled ""My Letters to Philosophers"" (1902-12).  George Santayana's correspondence with Strong, located in Series 2, is the largest single correspondence in the collection. The letters are uninterrupted for the period 1900 to 1939 and fill twenty folders. Most of the letters were written after 1912 during extended sojourns in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. Santayana's letters are warm and full of personal anecdote, and report on the books he is reading as well as the progress of his own writings, including ""The Realm of Matter"" (1930), ""The Realm of Truth"" (1937), ""The Realm of Spirit"" (1940), and the novel, ""The Last Puritan"" (1939). Although they remained loyal friends, Strong and Santayana continually disagreed over the scope and limits of perception. Their philosophical differences gradually took on a personal edge. After a 1938 meeting in Rome, which led to an altercation, Santayana wrote that he and Strong had fallen ""out of sympathy on almost every current subject."" In 1939, he declared, ""Your presuppositions as to what can and what cannot excite consciousness are not such as I feel any need of making."" Strong's letters to Santayana fill three folders and consist mainly of transcript drafts of letters for the years 1930, 1932 and 1933 concerning philosophical subjects.  The letters of William James to Charles Strong fill seven folders and are largely uninterrupted for the period 1898 to 1910, the year of James' death. In his letters, James discusses materialism, his reactions to Strong's writings, books he is reading, his teaching load, travel plans, family life, and the precarious state of his health. He describes in 1905 his first encounter with French philosopher Henri Bergson. Writing on 6 February 1906 from Palo Alto, where he was lecturing at Stanford University, he gives a lively account of his reaction to the San Francisco earthquake. Strong's letters to James fill one folder. Two letters (1889), written from Berlin, offer a theory of materialism explaining the relationship between the mind and the body, in which the human mind is a product of natural processes. Strong's theory found formal expression in his first book, ""Why the Mind has a Body"" (1903).  ",Charles Augustus Strong papers,,FA087,1961,"Open for research.

This program had emphasized the promotion of fundamental and applied social sciences and research in the areas of social disturbance and problems of socially maladjusted groups.   In 1933, the Trustees of the Foundation called for a program in human relations complementary to the medical science program in psychiatry and the natural sciences program in human biology. A program was developed which included international relations, economic stabilization, social security, the public administration. Special objectives of this program were the training of technical and administrative personnel and liaison between practitioner and research groups in these fields. Grants were made to organizations such as the Foreign Policy Association, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Institute of Pacific Relations and the Brookings Institution. Projects at leading universities were aided.   Other fields in which the Foundation had an interest include housing, cultural anthropology, and criminology. These were never developed fully. There was always a strong interest in strengthening the social science field, especially through such organizations as the American Association of Schools of Social Work and the Social Science Research Council. Most of the files in this section are from the 30's and 40's.   Directors of the social science program were Edmund E. Day (1929-1937), Sydnor H. Walker, Acting (1937-1938), and Joseph H. Willits (1939-1954).",Rockefeller Foundation records,"projects, SG 1.1, Series 100 International - Series 257 Virgin Islands, U.S.A.",FA386a,2000,"Open for research with select materials restricted as noted.

The Foundation's program in the medical sciences during this period was directed by Dr. Alan Gregg and was concentrated in psychiatry and neurology and related subjects - neuroanatomy, heredity, endocrinology, neuropathology, child guidance, industrial psychology and sex research. Emphasis was placed on worker training, selected research projects and measures to improve or extend the application of existing knowledge. The medical sciences program also devoted part of its resources to the development of university teaching departments of public health. The program was conceived to be complementary to the natural sciences program in human biology.

009119e2e4b44e63a4ba9ed934f414c5,Aspira Inc.,1963,,,Grants (series),,"The Grants series documents the Taconic Foundation's grantmaking from its inception in the late 1950s and early 1960s up to, but generally not including, its final grant cycles and spend-down in 2008-2012. Records concerning these latter grants are found, for the most part, not in the Grants series, but in the Organization Records series, under ""Grantmaking and Foundation History"" or under ""Spend-Down Process."" These late grants are grouped collectively rather than by individual grantee.  Grant files contain proposals, correspondence, and reports, and sometimes publications or literature relating to the institution or the particular grant. Most grant files also include one or more grant memos, which Taconic Foundation officers wrote for each new grant or renewal, setting forth for the board the terms of the request, the nature of the organization and its history with Taconic, previous funding, the pros and cons of the proposed grant, its fit with the Taconic program, and the recommended action.  The Taconic Foundation also funded a number of ""Projects"" that produced research and reports on issues of concern to the foundation or that resulted in the creation of new organizations that then benefited from Taconic grant support. Projects included, for example, the Assessment Project on Negro Needs, Davidoff's and Gold's proposals for low-income housing in lower Manhattan, the Voter Education Project, the Smokey House Project, and the Cooperative Assistance Fund.   A number of simple correspondence files are interspersed in this grants series. Each of these files generally contains just a few pieces of correspondence. While some correspondents have connections to Taconic projects, for the most part the correspondence files seem to be remnants of either a finite correspondence or a larger series. There is no general correspondence series in the Taconic records, and the Grants series constitutes the main series of files.  The Grants series is fairly comprehensive, but it is not a complete set of grant files. Some significant reports, such as Mary Conway Kohler's study of Youth and Work in New York, are not found in the files. Records are sparse or sometimes lacking for some of the Taconic Foundation's early grants. Many of the early programs were first launched with personal grants from the Curriers before the Taconic Foundation assumed their funding, and these hybrid origins may, perhaps, account for some of the gaps.
